3. SUBTASK-3: Ensure the existence of a DomainService file

- For every service in `packages/backend-modules/postgres/src/services`, confirm that a corresponding DomainService file exists.
- The DomainService file should follow the standard naming convention and file structure for domain services within this directory.
- If the DomainService file does not exist for a service, create it using the template and conventions defined in:
  `packages/backend-modules/postgres/.cursor/rules/@backend-modules-postgres.md`.
