9.  SUBTASK-09: Create a Pull Request (PR)

- After pushing your feature branch to the remote repository, open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.
- Ensure your PR includes a clear, descriptive title and summary of the database change, referencing the original issue or task.
- Confirm that all changes are staged and committed (`git add .`), and that your branch is up to date with `main`.
- Verify that all CI checks and code reviews pass before merging.
- Do not merge the PR yourself unless you have explicit approval or are the designated maintainer for this change.
