10. SUBTASK-10: Ensure entity documentation is up-to-date

- For every entity you add or modify, do the following:
  - At the very top of the entity file, add or update the TABLE-DOCUMENT comment block as shown in the `Table and Column Documentation Standards` section of `packages/postgres/.cursor/rules/@postgres.mdc`.
  - For each column and relationship, add or update a COLUMN-DOCUMENT comment block directly above its decorator, following the format in the same section.
